Productbox Frontend Code Challenge
==================================
RandoStore, an online store where anyone can put up any random item up for sale and anyone else can buy it.

A page for listing all items that you can add to your cart
A page to view all the items that you've checked out
A page that allows you to add new items
A homepage that allows you to navigate to the last three pages

Getting Started
---------------
Install the package dependencies by running the following command: `npm install`

Once the dependancies are installed, you can start the application server by running: `npm start`

Once the server is running, you can access the home page of the application by opening your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

I have already built and served the vite react app at port `3000`
